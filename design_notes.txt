I 'navigate' to a folder on my PC about .0001 times as much as most people.   Why?  Because I run (launch, etc) from kedit, and use named directories extensively.   Alt-G even clears the command line and says 
go<space> 

mc,C:\Ward\Mike\Chats\

Can you write a program launched from an icon in the tray?  

I was going to write one.   When you have clicked "download" on something, and you want to put it in <somehwere>   you'd click this icon and it would ask for the "friendly name" or "short name" of the directory, say, mike chats, which is "mc".   When you type mc and hit enter, it looks up and clipboards C:\Ward\Mike\Chats\

I just can't IMAGINE getting along without named directories.

I'm fairly certain shortcuts to exe files are trivial
windows gui apps are a breeze with Lazarus
putting stuff in the clipboard should be easy

Another way would be to have a shortcut key like ctrl-alt-N to pop open a message window asking for the name of the directory.  mc<enter> poof, you'r directory is clipped.
